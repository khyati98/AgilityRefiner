Automize the role of Coach in Shuttle run to improve agility of players
                           
Shuttle run is a test which is required to improve agility of players. This test requires the person to run back and forth between two parallel lines as fast as possible. The coach randomly directs the player forward/ backward or left/right and a stop watch is kept to record time of each round. The model agility refiner works the same way and reduces the task of coach. The manual instructions are replaced by the device and it gives average of time taken by player in ten rounds. This can be especially used by badminton player to test and refine their agility all alone. It can further be used by any sports person.
